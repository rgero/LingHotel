# Ling Hotel
This project is the "final" project of the modern React course that I am taking to brush up and solidify my skills on React.

## Libraries used
React Router, Styled Components, React Query, React Hook Form, Recharts (for the statistics page) 

## Tables in Database
There's four tables
    Cabins
    Guests
    Settings
    Bookings

As of right now I think project is "complete" as I want to work on other projects and learn other things. However if I were to revisit this I would definitely tweak the styling so that it actually has a good mobile implementation. Currently if a user comes up and tries to view it on mobile, nothing is really responsive. The sidebar actually takes up a large portion of the display port and is persistently covering all of the data.

I have a feeling that I will fix that in the upcoming weeks in between working on other projects.
